3.What is Data Science: {
  3.1.Data Science: {
    - Skill of extracting of knowledge from data
    - Using knowledge to predict the unknown
    - Improve business outcomes with the power of data
    - Employ techniques and theories drawn from broad areas of mathematics, statistics and information technology
  }
  3.2.Data Scientist: {
    - A practitioner of data science
    - Expertise in data engineering, analytics, statistics and business domain
    - Investigate complex business problems and 'use data' to provide solutions.
  }
  3.3.Data: {
    3.3.1.Entity: {
      - A thing that exists about which we research and predict in data science.
      - Entity has a business context.
      - Examples:
        + 'Customer' of a business
	+ 'Patient' at a hospital. The same person can be a patient and a customer, but the business context is different.
	+ 'Car'. Entities can be non living things.
    }
    3.3.2.Characteristics: {
      - Every entity has a set of characteristics. These are unique properties.
      - Properies too have a business context.
      - Examples: 
	+ Customer: Age, income group, gender, education
	+ Patient: Age, Blood Pressure, Weight, Family history.
	+ Car: Make, Model, Year, Engine, VIN
    }
    3.3.3.Environment: {
      - Environment points to the eco-system in which the entity exists or functions.
      - Environment is shared among entities. Multiple entities belong to the same environment.
      - Environment affects an entity's behavior
      - Examples:
	+ Customer: Country, City, Work Place
	+ Patient: City, Climate
	+ Car: Use (City/highway), Climate
    }
    3.3.4.Event: {
      - A significant business activity in which an entity participates.
      - Events happen in a said environment.
      - Examples:
	+ Customer: Browsing, store visit, sales call
	+ Patient: Doctor visit, blood test
	+ Car: Smog test, comparison test
    }
    3.3.5.Behavior: {
      - What an entity does during an event
      - Entities may have different behaviors in different environments
      - Examples:
	+ Customer: Phone Call vs email, Clickstream, response to offers
	+ Patient: Nausea, light-headed, cramps
	+ Car: Skid, acceleration, stopping distances
    }
    3.3.6.Outcome: {
      - The result of an activity deemed significant by the business
      - Outcome values can be:
	+ Boolean ( Yes/No, Pass/Fail)
	+ Continuous ( a numeric value)
	+ Class ( identification of type)
      - Examples:
	+ Customer: Sale ( boolean), sale vealue (continuous)
	+ Patient: Blood Presure value (continuous). Diabetes type (class)
 	+ Car: Smog levels (class), stopping distances (continuous), smog passed (boolean), car type (class)
    }
    3.3.7.Observation: {
      - A measurement of an event deemed significant by the business.
      - Captures information about: 
	+ Entities involved
	+ Characteristics of the entities
	+ Behavior
	+ Environment in which the behavior happens
	+ outcomes
      - An observation is also called a system of record
      - Examples:
	+ Customer: A phone call record, a buying transaction, an email offer
	+ Patient: A doctor visit record, a test result, a data capture from a monitoring device
	+ Car: Service record, smog test result
    }
    3.3.8.Dataset: {
      - A collection of observations
      - Each observation is typically called a record
      - Each record has a set of attributes that point to characteristics, behavior or outcomes.
      - A dataset can be:
	+ Structured (database records, spreadsheet)
	+ Unstructured (twitter feeds, newspaper articles)
	+ Semi-structured (email)
      - Data scientists collect and work on datasets to learn about entities and predict their future behavior/ outcomes.
    }
    3.3.9.Structured Data: {
      - Attributes are labeled and distinctly visible.
      - Easily searchable and queryable.
      - Stored easily in tables.
    }
    3.3.10.Unstructured Data: {
      - Data is continuous text.
      - Attributes are not distinctly labeled. They are present within the data.
      - Querying is not easy.
    }
    3.3.11.Semi-structured Data: {
      - Mix of structured and unstructured.
      - Some attributes are distinctly labeled. Others are hidden within free text
    }
    3.3.12.Summary: {
      - Entity, Characteristics, Environment, Event, Behavior, Outcomes, Observation, Dataset
    }
  }
}
